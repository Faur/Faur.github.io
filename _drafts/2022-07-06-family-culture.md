excerpt:    "
We think of culture as something between large groups of people: continents, countries, religions, sociotal classes.
We need to recognize that culture is a phenomenon on a much smaller scale.
Like 'company culture' all our communities has a culture, and the most important one is probably family culture.

Family mythology

Were you raised with stories of your ancestors 

Most US citizens have strong founding myths of when their family came to the US.
They have a mythology of adventure and risk taking.
They were raised on a story of striking out into the unknown.
And for the ones who are welloff today it is also a story of risk paying off (ignoring survivorship bias and the counter factual).
