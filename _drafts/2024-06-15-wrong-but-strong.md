## Not Even Wrong
"Not even wrong" is a vicious insult in scientific circles, reserved for the ideas so flawed that they can't be tested and thus are unfalsifialbe [^Pauli]. 
 They aren't a real hypothesis, and therefore they don't belong in serious scientific discussions. 
A wrong falsifiable hypothesis is better than a not wrong in-falsifiable 'hypothesis'.
This is foundational in physics and the hard sciences, but I would argue that this kind of firm statements are equally important in every field, including business.
<!-- Def: 
Firm statement ~ falsifiable hypothesis 
Fuzzy statement ~ in-falsifiable hypothesis
-->

[^Pauli]: This phrase is attributed to physicist Wolfgang Pauli, but the importance of falsifiability in sciecne has long been understood and emphasized by the likes of Popper and Hume, and it serves as a fundamental test for any statement: can it reasonably be falsified? This also provides the added benefit of a well defiend informational content: There is a hard boundary between what is and isn't included in the statement.]

## The Pull of Correctness
Fuzzy thinking, at it's best, comes from a desire to be correct and accurate.
The fuzzy thinker embraces the complexity and nuances of a subject matter, and strives to minimize errors in their mental model.
This forces them to include a large amount of details and accurately reflect the unknowns and complexity.
This leads to an understanding and description of reality that is as accurate as resources allow.

So far so good.
Fuzzy thinking is great for describing complext subjects.
The fuzzy thinker mistakenly believes that a more accurate model is more usefull.
Models aren't actionable.
For this we need plans, which are entirely different.

Alagory.
Would you rather have a gun that was accurate or a gun that was precise?


However, striving to avoid errors comes at a cost.
The nuances muddy the waters and prevent lookahead and forward planning.

Without the ability to predict the long-term implicatoins fuzzy thinking underestimates their importance.
The behavioral generators become greedy, focused on short term gain.

> NOTE. Image of a binary tree. Each node is a decision. A fuzzy thinker is like trying to model the entire tree. Except reality is much worse. Decisions and outcomes are rarely binary, and managing the tree becomes unweildy.

> The trap of fuzzy thinking lies in its seductive appeal. It offers a comforting illusion of thoroughness and accuracy. 
By attempting to account for every variable, fuzzy thinkers believe they are crafting the most accurate models. 
However, this overabundance of details often leads to models that are too complex to be practical. 
They become untestable and unfalsifiable, falling into the realm of "not even wrong."


> A common rebuttle is that the language we use should reflect the subject matter. 
Since the subject matter is complex, contain unknowns, and lacking clear distinctions, the language needs to reflect this in order to capture nuances.
This is a trap.
Striving for correctness leads to vague and therefore fuzzy writing.
Fuzzy writing leads to fuzzy thinking, which makes it harder to learn, communicate, and think.
<!-- todo: write out Learn: imprecise hypothesis. Not clear what is important. No agency no learning. -->
<!-- todo: write out communicate: collaborating. expanding team. Aligning -->
<!-- todo: write out think: planning. Modelling. -->

Fuzzy thinking also has a high overhead. Gathering and analyzing information, developing complex models, and ensuring consistency takes significant time and effort. This impedes and delays action and interaction with the real world which is the source of true learning and model improvement.

<!-- Trying to estimate a variable based on partial information a fuzzy thinking might reasonably model it as a probability distribution.
This uncertain will propagate through the model and increase the complexity.
If there is 70% probability of left, 30 for right, both scenarios must be accounted for, leading to an explosion of scenarios and conditions. -->

## No plan survives first contact 

Sharp thinking is characterized by simple interactions and omitting significant information.
These models greatly simplify the underlying phenomena, but provide a powerful structure that allows for clear analysis and decisive predictions.
In order to increase the model's utility a lot of information must be trimmed, even relevant information.
Poorly implemented firm thinking is naive and intellectually lazy.
The challenge is simplifying correctly.

Theory and practice

## Synthesis

Project should incorporate a phase of fuzzy thinking, but this phase must be limited and the end of a project should always be firm.
Design methodologies like the double diamond models illustrate this concept: an initial broad exploration phase followed by a convergence to clarity and precision. Firm thinking is essential not only for creating actionable plans but also for communicating and scaling efforts. Even if a fuzzy thinker can manage all complexities (doubtful), they will struggle to communicate their ideas effectively. Clear, firm models enable broader understanding and collaboration, essential for scaling beyond individual cognition.

Ultimately, the power of firm thinking lies in its simplicity and communicability. It allows for decisive action and effective collaboration, transforming complex ideas into executable strategies. Therefore, it is indeed better to be wrong than to be vague, for clarity drives progress, while vagueness stalls it.
Although there is room for fuzzy, firm is more important.

A clear theory can be more or less correct.
In either case it can lead to greater insight, either because of its direct explanatory power, or because XXX
A vague theory is off the correct-wrong spectrum.

Like bull shit, vague doesn't concern itself with reality

Correct, false, bull-shit.
