## Not even wrong
"Not even wrong" is a vicious insult reserved for the ideas or arguments, so imprecise or flawed, that they don't meet the basic criteria of a hypothesis: they can't be tested or falsified.
This puts them outside the realm of scientific discourse, making them useless for advancing knowledge or solving problems.
This phrase is attributed to physicist Wolfgang Pauli, but the importance of falsifiability in sciecne has long been understood and emphasized by the likes of Popper and Hume, and it serves as a fundamental test for any statement: can it reasonably be falsified?
This also provides the added benefit of a well defiend informational content.
There is a hard boundary between what is and isn't included in the statement.

In softer disciplines, such as humanities, business and politics, statements are generally not falsafiabel.
The problem with in-falsifiable statements is that it isn't guaranteed that their informational content is well defined.
Therefore a lot of people to fall into the trap of fuzzy thinking.
<!-- In other words, we run the risk of using fuzzy statements and fuzzy thinking -->


SOMETHING SOMETHING. THIS IS A PROBLEM.

## The Alure of Correctness

Fuzzy thinkers' starting point is an emphasis on correctness and accuracy.
When dealing with difficult or complexity phenomena, or incomplete information and uncertainty, the fuzzy thinker embraces this complexity and the nuances, striving to incorporate all relevant information into their mental model.
Fuzzy thinkers are reluctant to omit relevant details, aiming for a holistic understanding.
At its best this approach leads to a nuanced and deep understand of a situation.
The fuzzy thinker mistakenly assumes that a model with superior accuracy has superior utility.
When applied to strategy and plannign this leads to a balanced approach based on the likely scenarios, acting more as a generator of behavior than an actual strategy.

In theory, fuzzy thinking should be superior because it uses a more detailed description of reality, potentially leading to better-informed plans.
However, this breadth comes at a cost.
The nuances muddy the waters and prevent lookahead and forward planning.
Trying to estimate a variable based on partial information a fuzzy thinking might reasonably model it as a probability distribution.
This uncertain will propagate through the model and increase the complexity.
If there is 70% probability of left, 30 for right, both scenarios must be accounted for, leading to an explosion of scenarios and conditions.
Without the ability to predict the long-term implicatoins fuzzy thinking underestimates their importance.
The behavioral generators become greedy, focused on short term gain.


# The trap of fuzzy thinking lies in its seductive appeal. It offers a comforting illusion of thoroughness and accuracy. By attempting to account for every variable, fuzzy thinkers believe they are crafting the most accurate models. However, this overabundance of details often leads to models that are too complex to be practical. They become untestable and unfalsifiable, falling into the realm of "not even wrong."


Fuzzy thinking also has a high overhead.
Gathering and analyzing information, developing complex models, and ensuring consistency takes significant time and effort.
This impedes and delays action and interaction with the real world which is the source of true learning and model improvement.

Firm thinking is characterized by simple models with well-defined interactions. 
These models greatly simplify the underlying phenomena, but provide a powerful structure that allows for clear analysis and decisive predictions.
Poorly implemented firm thinking is naive and intellectually lazy.
The challenge is simplifying correctly.
In order to increase the model's utility a lot of information must be trimmed, even relevant information.

## Synthesis

Therefore, every project should incorporate a phase of fuzzy thinking, but this phase must be finite. Design methodologies like the diamond or double diamond models illustrate this concept: an initial broad exploration phase followed by a convergence to clarity and precision. Firm thinking is essential not only for creating actionable plans but also for communicating and scaling efforts. Even if a fuzzy thinker can manage all complexities (which is doubtful), they will struggle to communicate their ideas effectively. Clear, firm models enable broader understanding and collaboration, essential for scaling beyond individual cognition.

Ultimately, the power of firm thinking lies in its simplicity and communicability. It allows for decisive action and effective collaboration, transforming complex ideas into executable strategies. Therefore, it is indeed better to be wrong than to be vague, for clarity drives progress, while vagueness stalls it.

Some might argue that certain phenomena are inherently fuzzy and that our thinking should reflect this fuzziness. However, the more ambiguous the subject, the more essential it becomes to adopt firm thinking. 




A clear theory can be more or less correct.
In either case it can lead to greater insight, either because of its direct explanatory power, or because XXX
A vague theory is off the correct-wrong spectrum.

Like bull shit, vague doesn't concern itself with reality

Correct, false, bull-shit.
