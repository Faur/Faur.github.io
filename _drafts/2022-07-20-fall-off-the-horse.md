There are two proverbs that I hear from time to time.

1. 'If you fall of the horse, get back on.'
1. 'If you want to take the island, burn the ships.'

I use to think both of them were true.
But they are infact contradicting strategies, and you have to pick one (or none).

The **horse strategy**  states if you fail you should try again.
This implies that you get a second (and third and fourth) chance and that failures aren't that costly.
Just pick yourself up and try again.

The **ship strategy** states that if you want to win you should make failure extremely costly.
The best way to maximize plan A's chance of success is to not have a plan B.
Victory or death.



# By horse or by boat[^boat]
So when should you plan to fall of the horse, and when should you plan to burn the boat?

[^boat]: I like 'boat' more than 'ship'.

Intuition might say, when failure is cheap and trying again easy - go by horse, where as when failure is expensive go by boat.
This is excatly backwards.
The cheaper failing is more likely you are to allow it to happen.
If fell yourself slipping in the saddle, you might let go of the rains if you know the soft padding will catch you. 
Besides after falling off you get a break and a soda. 
If on the other side you are riding naked on a rocky country side you will hold on for dear life.
No amount of soda will convince you to let go.


I think this is why quitting smoking is so difficult.
Yes addiction is a thing.
But it isn't the entire story.
Quitting smoking is so difficult because falling of doesn't hurt (in fact it anti hurts) and getting back on is super easy.

> "It’s easy to quit smoking. I’ve done it a thousand times"[^quit_smoking]

If relapsing was costly it 

> If you don't want to fall of the horse, promis yourself that you will burn it if you do.

Not as catchy.




Having a 'get back on the horse quickly' mentality might seem like a good idea.
In many cases it is.
But not always.
Sometimes the opposite is better.
