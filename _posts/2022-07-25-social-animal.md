Community/tribe is the proper level of ananlysis
* Not individuals. Humans are social before they are individual
* Not families. They are still too smal units. 
* Not cities, or any other grouping in the thousands. People need to know the members of their group
* Not Nations. Nationalism is a powerful fiction, but it is wrong.
* Tribes. Communities. Neighborhoods. 50-150 people. With a shared history, culture, and philosophy.


Humans are fundamentally social animals.
The individual is therefore not the proper level of analysis.
To borrow from chemistry.
If the individual is the atom then the household is the functional group and the tribe is the molecule.

Chemistry is done at the level of molecules more than functional groups, and functional groups more than atoms.
