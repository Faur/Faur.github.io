excerpt:    "
There are atleast two kinds of systems.
One is hard, absolute, and keeps its shape.
Lets call this stone.
The other is soft, relative, and takes shape from its sourroundings.
Lets call this water.

[\\]: # Humans like stone. Technology (incl. law, government) ~ stone
Humans like stone. 
We build houses, computers, and contracts in stone.
Nice hard objects that keep their shape.
Humans like stone, because it is malleable and predictable.
If you place a stone on another stone you get exactly that: one on top of the other.
Sometimes we can harden a system.
The ability to turn electronics digital enabled all the computing and communication breakthroughs that we enjoy and base our lives on today.
At its core the invention of digital electronics took something soft (analogue electronics) and made it hard, such that they keep their shape. 
Once stable and predictable we build ever larger digital systems, like computers, satelite communication and the internet.
<!-- Similar for written contracts, financial systems, and life itself (at least the DNA part).-->
Similarly written law, formal religion, and governments in general are a hardening of human relations.

### Seasaw
Stone beats water in the short term. 
Water beats stone in the long term.


[\\]: # Water is unavoidable. We are water

Humans like stone so much that we sometimes forget about water.
Humans are, however, mostly water.
We forget that.
Evolutionarily we are characterized by flexibility and adaptability.
Polarbears die without ice.
Corals die if the pH change.
Humans adapt and take shape based on the nice that we happen to be in.

An obvious solution to degradation over time is maintenance - repairing the damage as it occurs.
This works well for cars. 
With proper care and maintenance there is no limit to how long a car can be kept running.
This also mostly 

Actually renewing continually is very difficult in artifical systems. Life manages by making death mandatory, and renewing the genes through reproduction. This approach works for cars, which after a while are replaced by new cars. As the scale of the artificial system grows this
