## SOP: Making a post

### SOP: File setup

Published post format: `/_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-PERMALINK-OF-POST.md`. 
* `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date of the first publication.
* Assests for the post should be in: `/assets/PERMALINK-OF-POST/`
* File attribute `permalink` should be set to `PERMALINK-OF-POST`, same as in the file name.
* File attribute `date` should be set to the most recent publish date.

Draft and WIP have no ruels associated with them

### SOP: Local compiling and serving

`cd` to the appropriate folder: `...\Faur.github.io`

Build the site and make it available on a local server.

    bundle exec jekyll serve

Then browse to: 

    http://localhost:4000/

### SOP: Publishing
1. Set `date` attribute the publish date today).
1. Commit files/changes to main git branch.
1. Push to origin.





## Setup and install

### Built with Jekyll
Basic [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) setup that almost entirely copies the setup of [Andrej Karpathy's blog](https://github.com/karpathy/karpathy.github.io) (as of 2022), which it self is very close to the vanilla Jekyll setup. I.e. nothing anything fancy.

I chose Jekyll because it is light weight (to use and load), I can reasonably understand what is going on, and once setup it is very quick to write posts using markdown and basic HTML.

### Install Jekyll
Follow the instructions:
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/

`cd` to the appropriate folder: `...\Faur.github.io`

	gem install bundle

    bundle update
