Are we responsible for our emotions? 
Or more relevantly are we responsible for our emotional responses? 
If not us, then who?

Our emotions sometimes lead to bad behavior that we wouldn't have committed if we had been in a different state of mind.
In mindset A we might do something that we later in mindset B regret.
Can we, in mindset B, distance ourselves from mindset A and what we did?

I think there two reasonable responses to this question.


# Answer 1: No. Free will is an illusion. 
Because Free Will is an illusion nobody has any influence on anything they do or feel.
Therefore nobody can be held responsible for anything. 
This is a valid philosophical argument that is hard to counter, but from a practical perspecitve it isn't very useful.
Actually it is the opposite of useful. 
It prevents us from using useful concepts like 'responsibility' at all. 
This is a reasonable response, but because it doesn't lead anywhere interesting I think it is a bad answer.


# Answer 2: No. You are not your emotions. 
'You' are the thinking, narrative self.
'You' are the self reading this. 
'You' is distinct from your body, your emotions, your subconscious, your â€¦ whatever. 
Within this frame a person is their conscious self, and only their conscious self. 

This frameing enables rationalizations such as

> "I wanted to buy you a birthday present, but my memory didn't remind me it was your birthday. Therefore I didn't, but it isn't my fault. It is my memory's fault. Stupid memory."

This way of thinking is appealing because it allows us to escape responsibility when we screw up.
Most people want to buy birthday presents for people they care about.
When they fail to do so they feel bad.
One way to make the bad feeling go away is to find a scape goat.
Since no external forces interferred we can't blame them.
We therefore do a clever trick and separate part of us from 'Us', that we then blame.
This is nothing more than an accounting trick.
Similar to financial accounting tricks it makes things look better on paper without actaully improving circumstances in the world.
Seeing your emotions as separate from 'You' is a great way of shirking responsibility.
Part of the appeal is because your emotions seem out of your control.


This reasoning is appealing from the inside, but not very convicing from the outside.
Imagine a city that has under invested in hurricane protection and emergency preparedness for years.
When the city is hit by a hurricane the damage is severe and relief efforts are valiant, but ineffective.
It is likely that the government will try and shirk responsibility.
They will say things like "its not our fault. We don't have control over hurricanes", "Don't blame us. We did our best to help the victims with the resources we had".
Both of these might be true, but I still think the government is responsible and thus to blame.
By under investing in preparation they doomed the efforts.

> Failing to plan is planning to fail
> Winston Churchill or Benjamin Franklin (probably)

We need to hold people accountible for not preparing sufficiently.



The worst part of this way of thinking is that it leads to bad behavior.
Why do anything to manage your emotional responses if it isn't your responsibility?





But why stop there?
Why are 'You' connected with the you of yesterday?
'You' don't have any influence on that person, so why should you be held responsible for what that person did or didn't do?

This kind of thinking quickly easily leads to some rather absurd denial of responsability.
And even a light challenge


I think this is common for modern rationalist types. 
I have though so myself.





# Answer 3: Yes. You are you.
Ask yourself this question: If your emotions and emotional responses are not your responsibility then who's responsibility are they?

Parents?
Socioty?



What does it mean to take on responsibility for something? 
It means to tie yourself to the outcome of the thing.
You put skin in the game.
Simply put:
If it goes poorly you did poorly.
If it goes well you did well.
For someone to take responsibility for something they must also have influence over the thing.

Taking responsibility is often called taking ownership of something.
This means you live with the consequences.
